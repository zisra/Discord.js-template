    - [ ] `/search` - Autocomplete

### Advanced (future)

## Contributions
I have not yet come across enough code to create a platform that is easy to contribute to, but later on I am happy to accept PRs if they are consistent to the current architecture and make sense to me. 

More is hopefully to come...
